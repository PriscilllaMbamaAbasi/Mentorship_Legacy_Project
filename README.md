# Mentorship Legacy Project
This code (mentorship legacy project) explores the use of calculating and visualising the population of districts in Madagascar using various python libraries. 
It builds on all the various libraries and data visualisation tools learnt during the mentorship programme and provides a step by step guide on how to calculate population of an area using zonal stats and geopandas.
